# Quiz_level_prediction
The model is used to analyse the user level on the game based on his current progress and accuracy of giving the answer of each question with its time taken complexity.

The model is quite fun and really interesting as here we are trying the expected level of a person in a quiz game
This can be way better by adding more feature as its a view idea to make it happen everything is inside there and you can also add more possible data feautre to make it work more realistic possible way!
